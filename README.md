# E8BarrierAdjustment

This mod simply prevents Eclipse 8 curse when damage is blocked by your temporary barrier. Also includes support for the Makeshift Plating item from [Sandswept](https://thunderstore.io/package/SandsweptTeam/Sandswept/).

This serves as a significant buff to barrier-related items in E8, and makes barrier feel more like it's 'blocking' the damage.
